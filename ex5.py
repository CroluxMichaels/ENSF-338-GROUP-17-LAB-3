#Q4
# Observations: 
# - Binary Insertion Sort is technically faster than Traditional Insertion Sort for larger datasets.
# - The advantage of binary search in finding the correct position reduces comparisons but does not eliminate shifts, this still takes time.
# - Traditional Insertion Sort performs better for small datasets but works worse as input size grows due to O(nÂ²) complexity.
# - Binary Insertion Sort reduces comparison operations but has the same O(nÂ²) time complexity due to shifting elements.

# Conclusion:
# Binary Insertion Sort is technically more efficient than Traditional Insertion Sort for larger input sizes but does not beat the performance of 
# advanced sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.
